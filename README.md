## GutCheck

Welcome! GutCheck is a tool for students and instructors alike - where instructors can gain valuable insight into how their students are tracking during lecture (confused, okay, totally understanding everything), and where students can annonymously let their teacher know that they aren't understanding the lecture content. I hope you enjoy this tool!
